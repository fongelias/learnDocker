## Basic Concepts
### Dockerfile
A `Dockerfile` containst commands a user would call on the command line to assemble an image.

`docker build -t [name:tag] [context]` can be used to build an image with the name:tag specified from a dockerfile.

`docker run -p [host port: container port] -ti [name:tag]` can be used to run the built image and publish the container's port to the host
